# Create Frontend Homepage Tasks

## Prompt
Create **Frontend Tasks** for implementing the integrated Homepage.

Tasks:
1. Connect auth state to homepage
2. Implement guest-only homepage UI
3. Implement authenticated redirect
4. Polish homepage interactions
5. Final responsive & accessibility pass

## Response
Generated 23 sequential, dependency-ordered tasks in `hackathon-todo/specs/features/frontend-homepage/tasks.md`. Organized tasks into 5 phases: Setup, Redirection logic, Marketing UI, API/Interactivity connection, and Polish. Each task includes a specific ID, priority label, and clear file path. Identified parallel execution opportunities for UI components and established a clear path to an MVP.

## Outcome
Task breakdown is complete. Ready for implementation.
